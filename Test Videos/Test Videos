Test results of the algorithm

Video 'vehicle_test36-Detection.mp4' is the output of the algorithm that detects moving objects from a different viewpoint, which wasn't used in the training samples. 
As a result of estimating shape descriptors and applying descriptive proximity, the algorithm presents a descriptively close object of the detected moving object in '36_result.png', descriptively near (similar) to vehicle 6 in the training dataset.

Video 'vehicle_test31-Detection.mp4' is the output of the algorithm that detects multiple moving objects together in each frame. 
As a result of estimating shape descriptors and applying descriptive proximity, the algorithm presents descriptively close objects of detected moving objects in '31_result.png', with descriptively near (similar) and far (dissimilar) objects.
